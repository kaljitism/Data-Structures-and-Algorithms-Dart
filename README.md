## What is an Algorithm? 

`**f: I => O**`

An algorithm is defined as a function which maps arbitrary sized input to fixed sized output. The function could be a single step or a series of steps. It can be applied just once, in iteration or under recursion. 

An algorithm has to be - 
1. Correct
2. Effecient

### Correctness
